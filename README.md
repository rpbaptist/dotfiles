# Dotfiles managed by rcm

This uses [rcm](https://github.com/thoughtbot/rcm) to manage the files locally.

## Usage

### Restore

```bash
git clone git@github.com:rpbaptist/dotfiles.git ~/.dotfiles
cd ~
rcup
```

### Add files

```bash
mkrc <file/dir>
```

## OSX branch

This branch is Mac only. My new employer insisted I use a Mac, so I'm doing the best I can to make it mine.

These files rely on installed and configured components:

- [yabai](https://github.com/koekeishiya/yabai)
- [limelight](https://github.com/koekeishiya/limelight)
- [simple-bar](https://github.com/Jean-Tinland/simple-bar)
  - depends on [Ã¼bersicht](https://github.com/felixhageloh/uebersicht)
- [Karabiner-Elements](https://github.com/pqrs-org/Karabiner-Elements)
  - with [Goku](https://github.com/yqrashawn/GokuRakuJoudo/)
- [stackline](https://github.com/AdamWagner/stackline/)
  - depends on [hammerspoon](https://github.com/Hammerspoon/)
